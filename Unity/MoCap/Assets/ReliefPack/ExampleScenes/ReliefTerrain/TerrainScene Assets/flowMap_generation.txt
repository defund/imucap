To generate flowMaps, you may use free tool by S. Adaszewski.
Stones_flowMap.ff file in this folder is flow field saved by the tool basing on Stones&pebbles heightmap texture.

Note that Stones_flowMap.png has been prepared to follow U texture direction and may look a bit weird when you'll try to force the flow in different direction by different surface normals (transforming object).
